#This is the simplest app in the world... 

**it could and only could record how many days you fighted for something and the amount of days will display in the right-top corner of the icon. **

###here is the reason why i wrote this stupid app:   
life is always a struggle and we'll fight for something beatiful, forever   
in this condition, i want to have a simplest app to show how many days i fall in love with a girl, or how many days since i learn objective-C   
so .. this it is ..


at the first time, i was only planning to make a app that have nothing but the badge number…   
but …  
friends make me to do something more...
